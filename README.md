# Desperate Snake game

Classic snake game with some addings. In this release there is a **hunger** functionality which makes the snake goes faster if it doesn't eat as it needs. This implementation was performed in Unity.
In this version there is a score and highscore to keep ranking those values. There is a button too to start to clear the last highscore and start from zero.
